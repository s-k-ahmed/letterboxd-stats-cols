# Letterboxd stats alt country colours

This is a basic Chrome extension that changes the background colours of the countries on Letterboxd stats pages. This extension has two major changes from the existing Letterboxd colour scheme: (1) the colours are broken up at a median value (green under the median, orange above the median), to make it easier to distinguish between lower and higher watch counts, (2) the higher watch counts have colours determined logarithmically, again to increase chromatic range since most users have a disproportionately high watch count for the USA.

The extension can be imported locally. I do not currently plan to make it available on the Chrome Webstore, and I do not give permission for other people to do so.

I'm planning to add a legend in a corner of the map showing the colour range.
